My name is Kamryn Tart, and I am a senior at Pascagoula High School. It has been an honor attending this school and making a positive name for myself in all of the four years being enrolled there. When I think about my personal brand, the first thing that comes to mind is the drive that I have to finish anything that I start. My brand defines my heart, and I have a hungry heart. I become extremely determined when I set my mind to accomplish a goal. The mindset that I have will not let me give up or give in. Three adjectives that describes my personal brand is fearless, focused, and unbreakable.These adjectives not only describe my personal brand, but it also describes my way of life.
 I would like to improve my sensitivity. Sometimes I take things to the heart that I should not. Sometimes I read too deep into the comments that people make or actions that people take. I am not saying that I should be a careless person, but some things just should not be taken as serious as others. I will hear a bad comment or joke someone said to me and think about it for days. I admire how some people can take a punch and move on with life. I am weak when it comes to failure. I do not like to let myself or others down. My strengths revolve around being focused. To be focused is to be ahead. I keep myself grounded  just to salvage my future. I fully understand that great things comes to those who work for it. My focus does not drift, it simply gets broader and brighter. The focus I have for college, my future career, and my brand balances out, because I have the same determination for all three. The desire that I have to stay focused is one of my strongest attributes. My skills include: communicating effectively, Interaction with multiple age groups, operating Microsoft PowerPoint, and leadership skills. My hobbies are crafting, practicing cosmetology, and spending quality time with family and friends.
